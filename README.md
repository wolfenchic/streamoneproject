### What is this website for?
This website acts as a bio and portfolio page for myself. I intend to use it to pursue freelance web development work and also to apply for jobs. 

### What does it do?
This website has various section pages for people to read about my career history, skills and the services I offer. I've included a downloadable CV for potential employers and a contact form for any potential clients who visit the site and wish to discuss potential collaboration further. 

### How does it work
 
This website was built using a Bootstrap framework. The site is a one page scroll with seperate page areas. The animation was executed using Javascript and jQuery and the style was executed predominantly using CSS. 

## Features

### Existing Features
- Eye catching landing image, introducing myself and highlighting key skills.
  - Automatic text typing effect using the Typewriter function. 
- About Me
  - Brief overview of my bio with an image of myself for personalisation. Link to downloadable cv. 
- Services page 
  - Highlights my key skills and the services I will offer to clients. 
  - This page includes jQuery animation features on the individual cards, changing the opacity level on `mouseover`. 
- Portfolio and Inspiration
    - As of now I do not have a portfolio so I've included an inspiration section to show the assesors how I will showcase my portfolio in the future. 
    - This page gives credit to the artist whose images I used throughout the site and links to his page on Pexels.com.
- Contact 
  - Contact form with multiple fields, one of which is required and a modal which is triggered on succesful form submission. 
- Footer
  - Contains my primary contact information along with my social media handles, clickable via Glyphicons. 
 

### Left To Do
- I intend to regularly update the Portfolio section of this website with projects I complete. As this section grows I may seperate the pages so users aren't having to scroll for a long time in order to reach the bottom of the page. 
- I may also add a Testimonials or Case Studies page depending on the work I do and my relationships with clients.
